In this elementary school, we worked with students in grades 1-4. We received a $1000 donation from **[INSAF](http://insafweb.org/)** for this project. From this, we provided many supplies to the students including desks to write on, microscopes, sports equipment, a TV, educational DVDs, art supplies and many more. Along with the supplies we conducted our interactive workshop.
