**Beyond the Book** is an organization that promotes holistic learning while relaying the message, **"Learning can be fun!"**
Through an applicative learning process, we help students in Indian villages look beyond the book and apply their knowledge to the real world.

#our mission#
To enlighten and enrich students with new interactive and practical aspects of learning through exposure, experience, and various forms of media.


#about#
We visit village studnets in grades one through 10 in the Sindhudurga district of Maharashtra, India and conduct workshops to develop these skills. In the workshop, we donate various supplies that promote the overall development of the children, whether it be sports equipment, art supplies, or scientific gadgets, we provide it all.

These provisions are made through the generous donations that we receive. During the workshop, we show and interact with the kids to teach them how to use the supplies as well as bring forward the applicative messages relayed.

Apart from being wildly satisfying for us, this week-long workshop awakens the hidden curiosity that each of these children has. This curiosity goes a long way, giving the usually confied students the ability to have a dream, question, and have thoughts that reach far beyond the boundaries of their village.
