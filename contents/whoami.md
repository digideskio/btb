My name is Radhika Gosavi. Besides being passionate about helping children in Indian villages look beyond the book, I am currently studying Cognitive Science (Neuroscience) and Psychology at the University of California, San Diego. Apart from my classes, I also gain an applicative perspective on my subject by researching in labs, including the Brain and Cognition Lab, headed by VS Ramachandran.

I have participated in competitive soccer as well as dance for the last decade. These activities have taught me about a lot more than just how to kick a ball and how to move around gracefully. They have helped build my character such that I am better able to face tough situations with composure, calmness, and logic. Apart from this they have also taught me how to work well in group settings and gain knowledge from experiences.

In the future I hope to earn a Ph.D. in the Neurosciences as well as build a fruitful, stable, and fun life for myself.
